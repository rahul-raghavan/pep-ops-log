**Subject: New Tool — PEP Ops Logger (start using today)**

Hi team,

We're rolling out **PEP Ops Logger**, a simple tool to track staff observations across our centers. It's live now and ready to use.

**What it does:**
- Log observations about nannies, drivers, and other staff — by typing or voice recording
- View observation history for any staff member at your center
- Generate AI-powered performance summaries with one click
- Download PDF reports when you need them

**How to get started:**
1. Go to **[app URL]** and sign in with your school Google account
2. You'll land on the Dashboard — use **Quick Log** to record your first observation
3. To log a detailed observation with voice, tap **Log Observation**
4. Browse your staff under **Staff** in the sidebar

**A few things to know:**
- You can only see staff and observations at the centers you're assigned to
- You can edit an observation within 24 hours of logging it (tap the pencil icon)
- Voice recordings are transcribed and polished automatically — the audio is never stored
- If you haven't logged anything in 3 days, you'll see a gentle reminder on the dashboard

**What we need from you:**
Start logging observations daily. Even short ones count — consistency matters more than length. This data helps us track performance patterns and have better conversations during reviews.
